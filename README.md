# Automated Data Collection and Analysis System for Scientific Machines

## Overview

This project automates the data collection, processing, and analysis of data generated by scientific machines such as the Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The system is designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data handling in a research environment.

## Features

1. **Data Extraction Automation**:
   - Developed Python scripts to automate the extraction of data from the UTM and UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
   - Simulated data extraction with realistic sample data.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations.
   - Processed raw data to calculate mean values and other statistics.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations using Matplotlib to provide immediate insights into the data.
   - Generated and saved plots as images.

4. **Automated Reporting**:
   - Developed an automated reporting system to generate comprehensive reports in CSV and PDF formats using libraries such as reportlab and fpdf.

5. **File and Directory Management**:
   - Managed files and directories efficiently using the os and pathlib modules.
   - Organized data storage to ensure easy access and retrieval.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Swastik023/UniTest-Automation.git
   cd UniTest-Automation/automated-data-collection
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Data Extraction

Run the data extraction script to simulate data extraction from the UTM and UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

```bash
python scripts/data_extraction.py
```

### Data Processing

Process the extracted data to calculate mean values and other statistics.

```bash
python scripts/data_processing.py
```

### Data Visualization

Visualize the processed data with Matplotlib.

```bash
python scripts/data_visualization.py
```

### Report Generation

Generate reports in CSV and PDF formats.

```bash
python scripts/report_generation.py
```

### File Management

Manage files and directories.

```bash
python scripts/file_management.py
```
